# PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Purpose
Academic dishonesty discrepant scores were registered and Maria has to adjust the scores and has asked for our help. Maria has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacing the math and reading scores with NaNs we then have to repeat the school district analysis, like the one we did throughout the Module 4 on Canvas, and finally write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
From viewing the dataframes, original versus the updated dataframe---by the looks of it, it seems that not much changed between the two dataframes, when removing the dishonest discrepant academic scores from Thomas High School. The only discernable change that is apparent is in the Thomas High School category. 

The original Per School Summary Dataframe dislays a very minute/ slight numeric difference compared to the Updated Per School Summary Data Frame. The first picture I am displaying is the original dataframe, followed by the updated/new dataframe. 

You will be able to visualize that not much of the entire datasheet has been affected.
