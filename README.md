# PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Purpose
Academic dishonesty discrepant scores were registered and Maria has to adjust the scores and has asked for our help. Maria has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacing the math and reading scores with NaNs we then have to repeat the school district analysis, like the one we did throughout the Module 4 on Canvas, and finally write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
From viewing the dataframes, original versus the updated dataframe---by the looks of it, it seems there is no significant change between the two dataframes, when removing the dishonest discrepant academic scores from Thomas High School. The visible change that can be seen is in the Thomas High School category row. 

The original Per School Summary Dataframe dislays a very minute/ slight numeric difference compared to the Updated Per School Summary Data Frame. The first picture I am displaying is the original dataframe, followed by the updated/new dataframe. 

You will be able to visualize that not much of the entire datasheet has been affected.

## Summary 

In terms of four majors changes, I would not technically call them "major changes"---as i previously stated, there is only slight/minute changes between the original and updated data frames (replacing 9th grade THS reading and math scores with NaNs). In the screen captures displayed above---you can see the changes that can be seen are in the columns AVERAGE MATH SCORES, AVERAGE READING SCORES, % PASSING MATH AND % PASSING READING, AND OVERALL PASSING. Based off the two data sets, my assupmtion is that replacing dishonest Thomas High School 9th graders' scores with NaNs did not have a major/ significant impact on the datasframes.
